  Well travelled, aspiring software craftsman who never fails to find things he wants to be the best at, and who works hard to try and make this the case. I recently changed careers and moved back to England to focus on learning code full time at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). It was the best decision I've ever made. I am looking to build on the passion I have for code and continue the pace of learning I've achieved so far.

#### Presenting and Public Speaking

Confident and comfortable presenting to large groups of people, even if I don't know them. Most proud of any presentation where I can get a genuine laugh, especially if it's with me, rather than at me.

- Presented to large and small groups of people at Makers including:
  - Final project presentations, parts of which can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/makersacademy/status/700746991995899904)
  - Makerthon presentations to my cohort. (Project can be found [here](https://github.com/AlanGabbianelli/WISHD) )
  - Whilst running regular stand ups and retro's
  - I also wrote blog for the duration of the course that can be found [here](https://36bcab.wordpress.com/).

- Recently gave a speech to neighbours, councillors and a planning committee at a planning deputation.

|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------------|
| Ruby, Rspec                 | Have completed many small projects in Ruby including [airport challenge](https://github.com/Adzz/airport_challenge), starting from user stories and iterating towards a complete well tested project.                        |
|Ruby on Rails | Experimented with an [instagram](https://github.com/Adzz/instagram-challenge) and [yelp](https://github.com/Adzz/yelp_clone_rails) clone in rails  |
| Javascript, Karma, Jasmine, Angular, Protractor, Jasmine.  | Concieved and built a [job tracking application](https://github.com/michaellennox/jobber) which included an angular front end with good e2e test coverage using Protractor and unit test coverage with Karma.|
| Python, Nose                | Built a python backend with Flask for my final project [Job Trackr] (https://github.com/michaellennox/jobber), a job tracking website to ease the process of job hunting. We tested it with unittest and Nose. The project was concieved and built in two weeks in a team of four.|
| Clojure, speclj             | Outside of Makers I have started to dabble in Clojure, begining with [fizzbuzz](https://github.com/Adzz/fizz-buzz-clojure), and continuing with the Speclj [tutorial](https://github.com/Adzz/clojure_speclj_change_counter) to get me up to speed on testing in clojure. I find functional programming incredibly interesting and powerful and aim to spend more time developing my skills here in the future. |
