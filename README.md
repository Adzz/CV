## [Adam Lancaster](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-lancaster-9845a23a?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic)

  A well travelled, aspiring software craftsman who never fails to find things he wants to be the best at, and who works hard to try and make this the case. Despite my work, the want is not usually fully realised, however the motivation to keep trying has yet to diminish; and I contend that's what really matters. After university I was lucky enough to stumble on an industry that would pay me well to travel around the world. I learnt, to my incredulity, that money wasn't everything, nor was travel, and so I started doing something that was. I am looking to continue the pace of learning I've achieved so far, and want to work somewhere that I am passionate about, where my skills can make a real difference.

## Skills and Experience

|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------------|
| Ruby, Rspec                 | Have completed many small projects in Ruby including [airport challenge](https://github.com/Adzz/airport_challenge), starting from user stories and iterating towards a complete well tested project.                        |
|Ruby on Rails | Experimented with an [instagram](https://github.com/Adzz/instagram-challenge) and [yelp](https://github.com/Adzz/yelp_clone_rails) clone in rails  |
| Javascript, Karma, Jasmine, Angular, Protractor, Jasmine.  | Concieved and built a [job tracking application](https://github.com/michaellennox/jobber) which included an angular front end with good e2e test coverage using Protractor and unit test coverage with Karma.|
| Python, Nose                | Built a python backend with Flask for my final project [Job Trackr] (https://github.com/michaellennox/jobber), a job tracking website to ease the process of job hunting. We tested it with unittest and Nose. The project was concieved and built in two weeks in a team of four.|
| Clojure, speclj             | Outside of Makers I have started to dabble in Clojure, begining with [fizzbuzz](https://github.com/Adzz/fizz-buzz-clojure), and continuing with the Speclj [tutorial](https://github.com/Adzz/clojure_speclj_change_counter) to get me up to speed on testing in clojure. I find functional programming incredibly interesting and powerful and aim to spend more time developing my skills here in the future. |


#### Presenting and Public Speaking

Confident and comfortable presenting to large groups of people, even if I don't know them. Most proud of any presentation where I can get a genuine laugh, especially if it's with me, rather than at me.

At Makers Academy I had several opportunities to present to large and small groups of people including:
- Final project presentations, parts of which can be found on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/makersacademy/status/700746991995899904]
- Makerthon presentations to my cohort. (Project can be found [here](https://github.com/AlanGabbianelli/WISHD) )
- Running regular stand ups and retro's
- I also wrote blog for the duration of the course that can be found [here](https://36bcab.wordpress.com/).

## Experience

**Motor Yacht Sky** (Sept 2014 to Nov 2015)    
Bosun

**JBT** (Feb 2014 to Present)   
Co founder/Head of Branding/Labourer  

As soon as I started yachting I began saving to invest in property with my brother. I branded and invested in his building company and helped with physical labour whenever I had time off work. We bought our first house in July 2015 and completed extensive renovations by January 2016. This required a demanding work ethic and careful time management as most of the renovation work overlapped with my time at Makers Academy. Aside from the physical work I sourced supplies, applied for various licenses and permissions with the council which included producing my own scale drawings of proposed work, and even attending a deputation at Portsmouth City Council, where I had to defend our plans in front of neighbours, council members and a planning committee.
