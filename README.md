#### Presenting and Public Speaking

Confident and comfortable presenting to large groups of people, even if I don't know them. Most proud of any presentation where I can get a genuine laugh, especially if it's with me, rather than at me.

- Volunteered to do a lightning talk at [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.london/) to what turned out to be an audience of over 150 people.
- Have given a two talks at various meetups. One on functional programming ([slides here](http://slides.com/adz/deck-1#/)), the other of which included live coding. Where I coded. Live.
- Presented to large and small groups of people at Makers including:
  - Final project presentations, parts of which can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/makersacademy/status/700746991995899904)
  - Makerthon presentations to my cohort. (Project can be found [here](https://github.com/AlanGabbianelli/WISHD) )

#### Collaboration

At Makers Academy we pair programme from day one. I am very comfortable working with others effectively. Am extremley personable and have extensive practice in doing what's needed to get the best out of a team.

- Pair programming at Makers Academy to produce a variety of [projects](https://github.com/Adzz)
- Successfully renovated and rented [my investment property](http://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/hampshire/portsmouth/4632549) on a very tight schedule and budget in a team of just two.
- As Alumni helper I regularly share knowledge with junior students to help with their learning. 
- Worked and lived with a team of 10 people whilst yachting. Produced extremely high standards under constantly changing circumstances.

#### Comfortable in difficult or uncertain cirumstances

One of the things I enjoy most about web development is that there is always more to learn. The consequence of this is that there's always something that you *don't* know. Being comfortable with situations like this is a skill I've had good practice with.

- Working on yachts was nomadic, plans changed frequently if they ever existed. Uncertainty was part of the job.
- Started a property business and successfully increased the value of out first property and rented it out.
